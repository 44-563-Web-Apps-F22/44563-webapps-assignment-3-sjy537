<h2>
    Forrest Gump is my favorite movie !
</h2>
<p>
    Movies that make you laugh, movies that make you ponder,movies that may excite you, but only a few can make you cry. Forrest Gump does it all Boy, tears rolled down for the first time after watching a movie of course there are other movies that followed but surely none of those were even close to this phenomenal motion picture Not that I am Hercules or Thor, but it takes immense poignance to make me cry Talking about Robert Zemeckis, the man always had a peculiarity in his direction but this is the one which stands tall among all.
